In Java, organizing code into classes is crucial for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Here are the main rules for organizing code into classes in Java:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class should have a single responsibility and should not be responsible for multiple, unrelated tasks.

2. Encapsulation
Classes should encapsulate their data and behavior, hiding their internal implementation details from the outside world.

3. Inheritance
Classes can inherit behavior and properties from parent classes, allowing for code reuse and a more hierarchical organization of code.

4. Polymorphism
Classes can be designed to take on multiple forms, allowing for more flexibility and generic code.
