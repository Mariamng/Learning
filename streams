Imagine you have a big box of toys, and you want to organize them in a certain way. You could do it yourself, one toy at a time, but that would take a long time. Instead, you could use a toy sorter machine that takes in toys at one end and spits out sorted toys at the other end.

In Java, a "stream" is like a toy sorter machine for data. It's a special kind of tool that takes in data at one end, performs a series of operations on it, and gives you the processed data at the other end. 

So, in short, a stream is a way to process data in a declarative and efficient way, without having to write a lot of manual looping code. It's a powerful tool that can make your Java code more concise and expressive!
